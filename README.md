**🏦 Banking Management System**

The **Banking Management System** is a **C-based console application** that simulates basic ATM operations such as cash deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and account records.

This project demonstrates the use of **file handling, control structures, structures, and procedural logic** in C programming to mimic the working of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).

The system supports multiple users/accounts, each with a unique account number and PIN. It uses text files to persist data such as transaction records, deposits, withdrawals, and balance information.

Project: **Banking Management System (C Console Application)**

**🎯 Objectives**

1. To automate and simulate basic banking operations.

2. To provide a user-friendly ATM interface for account holders.

3. To store transactions and account data using file handling in C.

4. To implement PIN authentication for security and access control.

5. To demonstrate modular C programming concepts such as structures, loops, and file I/O.


**🧩 Technical Concepts Used**

1. Structures (struct) for user record management.

2. File handling (FILE pointers) for reading/writing transaction data.

3. Loops and Switch-case for menu navigation.

4. Conditional branching for input validation.

5. Goto labels (used for navigation and flow control in menu).

6. System commands like system("cls") and system("exit") for console control.
   

**🧾 Limitations**

1. Uses text files instead of databases for record storage.

2. Flow control heavily depends on goto statements.

3. PINs and Account numbers are hardcoded.

4. Limited to 3 users in current implementation.

5. No input sanitization for incorrect formats (e.g., non-numeric entries).
